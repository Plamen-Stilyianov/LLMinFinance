The company's latest fiscal year reveals a concerning shift in cash flow dynamics. Operating cash flow plummeted to a negative $42 billion, a stark reversal from the previous year's positive inflow, indicating deteriorating core business profitability. Investing activities swung to a massive outflow of $163.4 billion, underscoring heavy capital expenditures and investments, contrasting sharply with the prior year's inflow. Financing activities, however, showed a positive inflow of $63.4 billion, driven by increased debt issuance, which only partially offsets the deficits in operating and investing cash flows. This pattern suggests a reliance on financing to sustain operations and investments, raising questions about long-term sustainability and liquidity risks. The company's cash management appears strained, with a declining end cash position, signaling potential challenges in maintaining growth and meeting financial obligations.
