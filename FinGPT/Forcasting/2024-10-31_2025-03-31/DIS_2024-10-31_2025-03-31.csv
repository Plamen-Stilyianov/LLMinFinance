Disney CFO Hugh Johnston sits down with Yahoo Finance\u2019s Executive Editor Brian Sozzi to discuss the print and what's next for the company. The CFO tells Yahoo Finance there are \u201ca couple of things going on right now,\u201d saying, \u201cObviously, 2024 was a terrific year, and Q4 was a great cap to a terrific year, 6% revenue growth, 21% [return on investment] ROI and then, of course, 39% [earning per share] EPS growth.\u201d Johnston adds, \u201cIn terms of the way we thought about the business, we've got two back-to-back billion-dollar movies. We've got terrific things going on with women's college basketball and college football. So, [we] certainly feel great about all of that. In addition to that, the streaming service now has turned significantly profitable for two quarters in a row. And then, of course, we had a record year in the experiences business. And then, last but not least, streaming. We added about six million subs over the third quarter. So I think it's a combination of all of those factors and the portfolio working.\u201d \u201cThe fact that we've been investing in those things as well is, and the fact that we've got sort of good visibility into the future is what has led us to provide forward guidance and, I think, the confidence that we have in those investments, whether it's the investments in streaming or the investments in the experiences business, is what's leading investors to basically look at the guidance and say, 'Yeah, this is something that that we're really bought into.\u2019 We feel very positively about it,\u201d he says. Johnston explains that the strategy under CEO Bob Iger\u2019s leadership is to focus on quality content rather than quantity. \u201cA few years ago, we were producing a lot of content to try to fill the streaming service, and we stretched ourselves in some ways, probably too thin. One of the things that Bob Iger said when he came back is I want to put creativity back into the center \u2026 I do think that that focus on raising the bar on quality and delivering, really, I think, the best content in the industry is, is an indication that the magic is back at Disney.\"" Watch the video above for more about Disney\u2019s streaming business, content strategy, experiences segment, the impact of the upcoming Trump administration, and more.

They have multiple platforms addressing multiple audiences. I mean, live sports is also a powerful driver of viewership. They have both the fully paid-for subscription model and an advertising paid subscription model, which they're expanding.

Johnston reported that Disney is considering external candidates for the soon-to-be-open CEO role, including Andrew Wilson, the EA CEO. \""Wilson has a pretty, pretty long-standing relationship with the company. He's known Bob Iger for a pretty long time ... The first major kind of encounter between the two, the two men and the two companies, was in 2018 when Andrew Wilson interviewed for the job of head of ESPN, a job that eventually went to Jimmy Pitaro, who is also in the mix as a potential CEO succession candidate.\"" Iger has reportedly checked in with Ted Sarandos, a co-CEO at Netflix (NFLX) to ask how the two-person CEO structure has worked out for the streaming giant. Johnston says, \""The two names that everyone has in mind when it comes to a potential co-CEO arrangement at Disney are Dana Walden, the co-chair of their entertainment division, and Josh D'Amaro, the chairman of the experiences division.\"" The reporter notes, \""It's unclear if that same structure would really work at Disney the way it has so well at Netflix.\"" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime here.
