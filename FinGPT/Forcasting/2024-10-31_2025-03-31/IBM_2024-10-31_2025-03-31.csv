In an interview with Yahoo Finance Anchor Seana Smith at the Yahoo Finance Invest conference, IBM Chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna discussed its investments in AI, regulation, and how he is evolving the computing giant for the future. In Krishna's view, the future is incredibly bright, especially under a new administration that may cut red tape. \""I think the AI spending from our clients is going to go up, I think the automation spending is going to go up, the labor demographics are going to get even worse, there's some policy statements that have implied that. Well, technology is a way to replace labor, so that means more technology will get deployed by our clients, and so those are the kinds of vectors that we are looking at to help accelerate our business.\"" Krishna also took issue with criticism that IBM's AI spending was not yet profitable, pointing to its generative AI book of business, which now stands at more than $3 billion, saying: \""I think in the past you might've been able to ding us that we were not able to monetize or convert our research into actual dollars. I think the last three years have been quite different.\"" As for offering up more compelling use cases for AI, Krishna said that just because they haven't all presented themselves yet, doesn't mean they won't be showing up later. \""This is one of those where if five years from now you're not using it (AI) in every part of your business, you're going to be fundamentally disadvantaged.\""To watch live and see every interview from Yahoo Finance Invest, click here.

D.A. Davidson Managing Director Gil Luria joins Morning Brief Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith to discuss where IBM stands in the AI era and how businesses are leveraging the emerging tech. IBM has \""one of the most valuable businesses in AI right now, which is a consulting business that helps companies figure out what they're going to do with AI,\"" Luria says, adding, \""Unfortunately for them, it's a relatively small part of the business. The overall business depends on a lot of other services and hardware and business process outsourcing. So, it may not drive very rapid growth for the overall company, but that consulting business is doing phenomenally well right now because so many companies want to know what to do with AI.\"" The analyst explains that \""almost all of AI spend right now is experimental. There's very few real-life products that are adding value and scaling, and that's not too surprising ... This technology is extraordinarily young. The big breakthroughs only happened a couple of years ago. Many of the breakthroughs just happened months ago. And so it takes a lot of time to refine this type of technology and to move it from being a breakthrough in science to being a productive enterprise software product that we can all use and create efficiencies and drive new revenue.\"" Luria notes that AI for enterprise use requires different standards than consumer AI. \""This AI technology still has to be refined. Let's not forget that just because we're okay with ChatGPT giving us a wrong answer one out of every five times, that's not the case for enterprise software. The technology has to be at a point where hallucinations are near zero for us to actually implement them in a real environment and use them for mission-critical systems.
