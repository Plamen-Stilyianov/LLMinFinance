And so there have already been compromises, for example, on environmental reviews, where fabs are not going to need National Environmental Policy Act reviews, and that's all meant to kind of accelerate this process. So, in terms of trying to shore up the CHIPS Act, I would see those kinds of provisions being targeted but not the overall strategic goal of getting funding behind bolstering chip manufacturing in the United States,\"" the strategist says. She adds that \""technology controls targeting China are going to be a major feature of either administration,\"" with Trump saying he'll instate hefty tariffs while Harris may be more of the same, maintaining the status quo of the Biden administration.

The semiconductor industry is \""one of the most global industries,\"" the analyst says. On the prospect that the US can completely decouple from China in the chip sector, he says \""I'll hesitate to use the word impossible, but it's very difficult. But clearly, even from the first Trump term, that was where they were trying to go.\"" He explains, \""The actions that the Biden administration took, I would say, were more surgical. They went after specific things. They went after high-end AI chips. They went after semiconductor equipment for advanced logic and memory, but they weren't really trying to necessarily blow everything up. It was it was manageable. With Trump, he's more like a bull in a china shop.\"" Rasgon says Trump's 60% tariffs \""would have massive implications both in and out of semis.\"" He notes that there wouldn't be \""a lot of direct impact for semis on tariffs\"" since most of the chips coming into the US from China are in other products like smartphones and PCs. \"" It's almost like a secondary kind of thing, if he puts massive tariffs on to make it up on smartphones and PCs, that's going to raise the price of those products in their end markets, and is that going to reduce demand [which,] will certainly roll down to the semiconductors.\"" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.

The impact of Trump's second term on the semiconductor sector, which has become especially important during the artificial intelligence (AI) era, has been debated, given the impact of tariffs and uncertainty around the CHIPS and Science Act. Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead and Tufts University professor of International History Christopher Miller join Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to discuss their outlook for the chip sector under Trump 2.0. Moorhead expects Trump to be a \""net positive\"" for the chip sector: \""Trump doesn't want to be the president that tanked the tech stock market, and he certainly could do that if he puts any weight on the chip stocks that have been a tremendous part of the growth over the last four years.\"" \""With all of the advanced semiconductor manufacturing leaving the United States, or most of it, Trump's trying to get the best deal to bring it back in. I do not believe he will tank the stock market or major industries to make that happen,\"" Moorhead notes. Miller \u2014 the author of Chip War: The Fight for World's Most Critical Technology \u2014 says Trump's chip policy is \""being defined right now by the president-elect and his incoming administration,\"" adding that tariffs will likely be a key component of his approach to the semiconductor sector, though there will likely be negotiations between his proposals and the actual policies. Amid uncertainty about Trump's actual policies and their impacts on chipmakers, Moorhead cautions investors saying they \""should be looking into every one of their investment plays and seeing if they have a supply chain resilience plan. It's a what if [plan].\"" Watch the video above to learn more about the US-China trade war, the impact of major chipmakers, and more.
