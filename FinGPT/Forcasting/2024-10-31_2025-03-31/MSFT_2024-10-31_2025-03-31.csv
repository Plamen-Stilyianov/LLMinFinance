ClearView Energy Partners managing director Timothy Fox joins Asking for a Trend Host Josh Lipton to discuss what the news means for Big Tech's nuclear push. \""Ultimately, we think the Federal Energy Regulatory [Commission] decision is a short-term setback for generators that wish to co-locate their load or co-locate their power with a data center and also a setback for the data center developers.

They're concerned about reliability, taking in existing large nuclear power plants offline. Does that create reliability risks? They're also concerned about ratepayers. Do existing ratepayers have to pay some unfair portion of the cost of upgrading the grid to accommodate a new data center? And then also the third concern is policy.
