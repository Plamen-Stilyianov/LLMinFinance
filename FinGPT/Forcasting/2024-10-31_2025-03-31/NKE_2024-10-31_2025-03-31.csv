But this is a business that has the largest marketing budget in the world, right? When Nike wants to win, when they're ready to win, when they have the product to win, the storytelling will follow.\"" Though Yih agreed, she suggested there are other stocks that are a better play such as Foot Locker (FL) or Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS). Yih also expects a turnaround in the new year for Gap (GAP) because of Richard Dickson, who joined the company as CEO in August 2023.
